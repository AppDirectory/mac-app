Create quickly a random, secure email alias on any website.

All emails going to an alias will be **_forwarded_** to your personal inbox.

### B. Control who can send you emails

Simply _**block**_ an alias if it's too spammy

### C. Reply with an alias

Not only an alias can receive emails, it can _**send**_ emails too.

Simply hit "Reply" in your favorite email client and the reply will come from the alias.

Your personal email address is never revealed.
